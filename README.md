# Oxisense

Oxisense is a microcontroller-based wearable designed to measure the user’s heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in real time. The project is developed as part of the master-level course **Microcontroller (CM2036)**, which focuses on C-programming, embedded hardware design, and real-time data processing in microcontroller systems.

The goal of Oxisense is to create a simple, portable, and reliable solution for monitoring vital signs in everyday life, during workouts, or as support for personal health tracking. As the project evolves, the team also plans to develop a companion mobile app to extend functionality and enable long-term data visualization.

## Features

* Heart rate measurement (BPM)
* Oxygen saturation measurement (SpO2)
* Real-time value display via LED display
* Microcontroller-driven data collection and signal processing

## Technology

* Microcontroller (RISC-V)
* Pulse and SpO2 sensor (MAX30102)
* Embedded C programming
* Swift-code
* Lightweight hardware design for wearable integration
* Bluetooth
* SD-Card

## Project Status

Oxisense is an ongoing student project. Functionality, design, and codebase are actively being developed and refined. Future work includes integrating wireless communication and creating a dedicated mobile application for extended monitoring and user interaction.
